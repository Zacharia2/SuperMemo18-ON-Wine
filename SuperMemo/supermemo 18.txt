Learning
Algorithm SM-18 with a new approach to determining item difficulty
new universal algorithm metric
collecting and displaying stabilization curves that determine the efficency of review
collecting and displaying retrievability-based forgetting curves to determine the efficiency of the algorithm
simplified editing of repetition histories (e.g. Aug 15, 1995 or Int=6 are allowed instead of full repetition data)
recalibrating SuperMemo Algorithm to rely on E(SInc[]) rather than SInc[]
maximum interval increased to 120 years (previously 10,000 days, i.e. 37 years)
repetition history can be used to override learning parameters
Undo Repetition (items are made pending when the last record is deleted)
grade undo is possible by editing the last repetition history record (or using Undo Repetition)
Interface
40 predefined themes (skins)
each collection can use its own theme (skin)
all toolbars available as tabs at the bottom of the element window
emojis used for grades instead of grade names (names known from previous SuperMemos can be restored via Options)
Emoji-based grade panel in SuperMemo 18

Figure: In SuperMemo 18, grades are illustrated with vivid emojis by default. If you prefer the old text-based grades (i.e. Great, Pass, Bad, etc.), uncheck Grade icons in Toolkit : Options : SuperMemo.
Performance
SuperMemo 18 has been recompiled with Delphi 10.2 Tokyo
minimizing add on units to capitalize on native Delphi support
resetting statistics at Memorized=0 does not reset the collection, only deletes files
Bugs fixed
https:// image import could fail if https files had not http access
occasionally, RTF files would fail to upgrade to HTML (old format retained)
Alarm : Start could instantly raise the alarm for time>0
Warnings
No more floating toolbars
No more toolbar dock
No more translation import and export via text
Window:Select:Next window removed
No more stray repetition export from repetition history
Additional repetition history warnings Wrong repetition, grade and lapses match can only be fixed manually (e.g. Fix and Edit)
